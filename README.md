# IntelliJ Hackatime
The Wakatime IntelliJ plugin is kinda buggy sometimes, so here is a solution
to a very specific problem I have with a very specific problem! :D

With some luck I won't be the only person that finds this useful...

(It's basically a recode on Kotlin of the already existing WakaTime plugin, so yeaaaaah...)

# How to use
To install the plugin, follow these easy steps:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dorythecat/IntelliJHackatime/releases/tag/release) from the GitHub.
2. Open up your preferred Jetbrains IDE.
3. Click `Ctrl+Alt+S` to open the settings menu (Or go to File -> Settings on the IDE)
4. Go to `Plugins`.
5. Click on the settings wheel inside this menu, and then on `Install Plugin from from Disk...`.
6. Select the Plugin's jar.
7. All set! :D

The program is a bit buggy at the time, but hopefully it works right for ya, and if not, please open an Issue. Thank you in advance. <3
