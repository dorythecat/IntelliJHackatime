# IntelliJ Hackatime
The Wakatime IntelliJ plugin is kinda buggy sometimes, so here is a solution
to a very specific problem I have with a very specific problem! :D

With some luck I won't be the only person that finds this useful...

(It's basically a recode on Kotlin of the already existing WakaTime plugin, so yeaaaaah...)

# How to use
To use it, just download the plugin and add it from the IDE. Simple, and easy :D

If it doesn't work it's not my fault :3
